# Intelligent Fishcarelab System (IFS) for Koi Fish Farming

## Overview
This project aims to develop an intelligent system for modern koi fish farming using IoT devices, a backend server, and a frontend dashboard. The system is designed to handle five types of koi fish, each with specific optimal temperature and pH ranges.

## Components
- **Arduino**: Used for direct sensor management (e.g., temperature, humidity).
- **Raspberry Pi**: Used for high-level control and data processing.
- **Flask**: Backend server to handle data storage and retrieval.
- **Frontend**: Simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to display the dashboard.

## Features
- Real-time monitoring of water temperature and pH.
- Automatic control of water pumps based on temperature.
- Data visualization on a web dashboard.
- Support for multiple koi types with specific environmental requirements.
